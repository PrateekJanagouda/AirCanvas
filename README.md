# Virtual Paint App with Hand Gesture Recognition

This is a computer vision project that lets you draw on a virtual canvas using your hand gestures, powered by OpenCV and Mediapipe. You can switch between **Draw** mode and **Shapes** mode, allowing you to draw freehand lines or interactively select, drag, and fix shapes (rectangles, circles, arrows).
